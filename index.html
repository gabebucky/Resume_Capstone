    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I'm Gabe, an aspiring full-stack web developer currently building a solid 
        foundation in web development. Though I’m just a few weeks into my journey, I’ve 
        completed various introductory courses, including a one-week program with Career Foundry 
        and I am in the process of completing a comprehensive Udemy course. 
        I'm already feeling positive about my future in this field.</p>
        
    <p>I’m passionate about both front-end and back-end development and am developing 
        skills in key technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 
        I also hold a Google certification in Technical Support Fundamentals, which 
        has strengthened my technical problem-solving abilities. Debugging code and solving 
        challenging problems are some of the aspects of development that I find the most rewarding.</p>

    <p>Currently, I'm working towards completing a full-stack web development certification with Career Foundry, 
        and my goal is to find an opportunity to contribute to a dynamic company as a web developer once I’ve completed my course.</p>
